Dear BAN-Members,

30 years have gone by since the Fall of the Berliner Wall, one of the most symbolic events of the 20th century.

On our next meetup we're going to an exhibition, which explores the concepts of dividing and separating space through physical boundaries. What impact does a wall have on our spatial perception and environment? How do we deal with and react to it?

Artists around the world were invited to brainstorm around this topic and bring their work together in this exhibition. Here's some more information:

Come along, let's meet at the Gropius Bau and celebrate together the 30th anniversary of this historic event!
